The intension of introducing Rift Herald to game is to have an in-game monster that is equivalent to dragons in the ealy game 
(Before 20 minutes. Rift Herald spawns at the 9:50 mark. If Rift Herald is not taken, it will be despawned permanently at 19:45/19:55). 
Due to the buff of summoned Rift Herald, it can due 40% of its current health to towers, which can easily take down a tower in early game.

Taking down a tower early game could lead to shorter game length since the game may finish earlier. Therefore, we will take a look at how 
the introduction of Rift Herald will influence game length. If we see game length difference between games with taken down Rift Herald and 
not taken Rift Herald, then we will obtain the average game length of those games, and perform hypothesis analysis.
